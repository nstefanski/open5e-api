    "desc": "### Rage \n \nIn battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. \n \nWhile raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor: \n \n* You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. \n* When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table. \n* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. \n \nIf you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging. \n \nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. \n \nOnce you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. \n \n### Unarmored Defense \n \nWhile you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. \n \n### Reckless Attack \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn. \n \n### Danger Sense \n \nAt 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. \n \nYou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated. \n \n### Primal Path \n \nAt 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n### Fast Movement \n \nStarting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor. \n \n### Feral Instinct \n \nBy 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. \n \nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn. \n \n### Brutal Critical \n \nBeginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. \n \nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level. \n \n### Relentless Rage \n \nStarting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. \n \nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10. \n \n### Persistent Rage \n \nBeginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it. \n \n### Indomitable Might \n \nBeginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total. \n \n### Primal Champion \n \nAt 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.",

    "name": "Bard",
    "desc": "### Spellcasting \n \nYou have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. \n \nYour spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table. \n \n#### Spell Slots \n \nThe Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell *cure wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *cure wounds* using either slot. \n \n#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher \n \nYou know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list. \n \nThe Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. \n \nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n#### Ritual Casting \n \nYou can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a musical instrument (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. \n \n### Bardic Inspiration \n \nYou can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. \n \nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. \n \nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. \n \nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level. \n \n### Jack of All Trades \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus. \n \n### Song of Rest \n \nBeginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points. \n \nThe extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level. \n \n### Bard College \n \nAt 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of \n \nthe class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level. \n \n### Expertise \n \nAt 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. \n \nAt 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Font of Inspiration \n \nBeginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest. \n \n### Countercharm \n \nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required). \n \n### Magical Secrets \n \nBy 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. \n \nThe chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table. \n \nYou learn two additional spells from any class at 14th level and again at 18th level. \n \n### Superior Inspiration \n \nAt 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.",

    "desc": "### Spellcasting \n \nAs a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table. \n \n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \n \nThe Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nYou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four \n1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n \nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n#### Ritual Casting \n \nYou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. \n \n### Divine Domain \n \nChoose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels. \n \n#### Domain Spells \n \nEach domain has a list of spells-its domain spells- that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. \n \nIf you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. \n \n### Channel Divinity \n \nAt 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. \n \nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. \n \nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. \n \nBeginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel \n \nDivinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. \n \n#### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead \n \nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. \n \nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Destroy Undead \n \nStarting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table. \n \n**Destroy Undead (table)** \n \n| Cleric Level | Destroys Undead of CR... | \n|--------------|--------------------------| \n| 5th          | 1/2 or lower             | \n| 8th          | 1 or lower               | \n| 11th         | 2 or lower               | \n| 14th         | 3 or lower               | \n| 17th         | 4 or lower               | \n \n### Divine Intervention \n \nBeginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. \n \nImploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. \n \nIf your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest. \n \nAt 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.",

    "name": "Druid",
    "desc": "### Druidic \n \nYou know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic. \n \n### Spellcasting \n \nDrawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nAt 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table. \n \n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \n \nThe Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n \nYou can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n \n### Spellcasting Ability \n \nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n### Ritual Casting \n \nYou can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a druidic focus (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. \n \n### Wild Shape \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. \n \nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed. \n \n**Beast Shapes (table)** \n \n| Level | Max. CR | Limitations                 | Example     | \n|-------|---------|-----------------------------|-------------| \n| 2nd   | 1/4     | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf        | \n| 4th   | 1/2     | No flying speed             | Crocodile   | \n| 8th   | 1       | -                           | Giant eagle | \n \nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. \n \nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply: \n \n* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them. \n* When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious. \n* You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that you've already cast. \n* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. \n* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. \n \n### Druid Circle \n \nAt 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Timeless Body \n \nStarting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. \n \n### Beast Spells \n \nBeginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components. \n \n### Archdruid \n \nAt 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. \n \nAdditionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.",

    "desc": "### Fighting Style \n \nYou adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. \n \n#### Archery \n \nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. \n \n#### Defense \n \nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. \n \n#### Dueling \n \nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. \n \n#### Great Weapon Fighting \n \nWhen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. \n \n#### Protection \n \nWhen a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. \n \n#### Two-Weapon Fighting \n \nWhen you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. \n \n### Second Wind \n \nYou have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. \n \n### Action Surge \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action. \n \nOnce you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn. \n \n### Martial Archetype \n \nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose Champion, Battle Master, or Eldritch Knight, all detailed at the end of the class description. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \nThe number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class. \n \n### Indomitable \n \nBeginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. \n \nYou can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.\n \n### Martial Archetypes \n \nDifferent fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.",

    "name": "Monk",
    "desc": "### Unarmored Defense \n \nBeginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. \n \n### Martial Arts \n \nAt 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two- handed or heavy property. \n \nYou gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield: \n \n* You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. \n* You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. \n* When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. \n \nCertain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon. \n \n### Ki \n \nStarting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. \n \nYou can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class. \n \nWhen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. \n \nSome of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \n \n**Ki save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n#### Flurry of Blows \n \nImmediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action. \n \n#### Patient Defense \n \nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn. \n \n#### Step of the Wind \n \nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn. \n \n### Unarmored Movement \n \nStarting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table. \n \nAt 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move. \n \n### Monastic Tradition \n \nWhen you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. \n \n### Deflect Missiles \n \nStarting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. \n \nIf you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Slow Fall \n \nBeginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n### Stunning Strike \n \nStarting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. \n \n### Ki-Empowered Strikes \n \nStarting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. \n \n### Evasion \n \nAt 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a *fireball* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. \n \n### Stillness of Mind \n \nStarting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened. \n \n### Purity of Body \n \nAt 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison. \n \n### Tongue of the Sun and Moon \n \nStarting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say. \n \n### Diamond Soul \n \nBeginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws. \n \nAdditionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result. \n \n### Timeless Body \n \nAt 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water. \n \n### Empty Body \n \nBeginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage. \n \nAdditionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the *astral projection* spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you. \n \n### Perfect Self \n \nAt 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points. \n \n### Monastic Traditions \n \nThree traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.",

    "desc": "### Divine Sense \n \nThe presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire \n \nCount Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the *hallow* spell. \n \nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses. \n \n### Lay on Hands \n \nYour blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5. \n \nAs an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. \n \nAlternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one. \n \nThis feature has no effect on undead and constructs. \n \n### Fighting Style \n \nAt 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. \n \n#### Defense \n \nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. \n \n#### Dueling \n \nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. \n \n#### Great Weapon Fighting \n \nWhen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. \n \n#### Protection \n \nWhen a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. \n \n### Spellcasting \n \nBy 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. \n \n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \n \nThe Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nYou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \nFor example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd- level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n \nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells. \n \n### Divine Smite \n \nStarting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend. \n \n### Divine Health \n \nBy 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.\n\n ### Sacred Oath \n\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class description. \n \nYour choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature. \n \n#### Oath Spells \n \nEach oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. \n \nIf you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you. \n \n#### Channel Divinity \n \nYour oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it. \n \nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. \n \nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.\n\n>### Breaking Your Oath \n>\n> A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath. \n> \n> A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all- night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh. \n> \n> If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.\n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n### Aura of Protection \n \nStarting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus. \n \nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. \n \n### Aura of Courage \n \nStarting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious. \n \nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. \n \n### Improved Divine Smite \n \nBy 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite. \n \n### Cleansing Touch \n \nBeginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. \n \nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. \n \n### Sacred Oaths \n \nBecoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.",
